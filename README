CatMatch - an html5 game
========================

This is a simple memory matching game created to show at AppsWorld 2012, http://www.apps-world.net

It was going to be a start from scratch game, but I soon realised it wasn't possible to code the whole thing in 30 mins !

So, starting from a very basic html page and some simple css we're going to write the code needed to turn it into a game.

If you want to try this out after the event then you will need to register for an API key at http://developer.pearson.com

Enjoy
