CatMatch - an html5 game
========================

This is a simple memory matching game created to show at AppsWorld 2012, http://www.apps-world.net

It was going to be a start from scratch game, but I soon realised it wasn't possible to code the whole thing in 30 mins !

So, starting from a very basic html page and some simple css we're going to write the code needed to turn it into a game.

If you want to try this out after the event then you will need to register for an API key at http://developer.pearson.com

1. Basic html layout

This is just some html containing links to resources we will use. We will code catmatch.js later. The dkimages.js script is 
a reusable module for invoking the dkimages.com API, feel free to clone/fork as you wish. The css is obviously for styling.
The two external libraries are: jQuery & ICanHaz. You may not have come across ICanHaz, it allows you to template html in a
html file, using mustache and so easily add html elements into your dom without worring about long html strings in code.

The body of the html is four sections:
  welcome screen
  initialisation screen
  main game screen
  play again screen
